    “For many of us the time since the pandemic started has felt weird, for some of us the months flew by, for others time seems to almost stand still. And while on earth so many aspects of our lifes feel as if they are on pause, the planet is still turning and we are still moving through time and space. I'd like to travel to the moon so I could look at the earth turning at the same speed it always has been turning, I am sure it would be a calming sight.” - Mia
